# Summary  

This report has been prepared for O2Lab VRust Team to discover issues and vulnerabilities in the source code of the O2Lab VRust Team project as well as any contract dependencies that were not part of an officially recognized library. A comprehensive examination has been performed, utilizing Static Analysis and Manual Review techniques.
The auditing process pays special attention to the following considerations:



* Testing the smart contracts against both common and uncommon attack vectors. 
                

* Assessing the codebase to ensure compliance with current best practices and industry standards.
                

* Ensuring contract logic meets the specifications and intentions of the client.
                

* Cross referencing contract structure and implementation against similar smart contracts produced
                by industry leaders.
                

* Thorough line-by-line manual review of the entire codebase by industry experts. 

 The security assessment resulted in findings that ranged from critical to informational. We recommend
addressing these findings to ensure a high level of security standards and industry practices.
We suggest
recommendations that could better serve the project from the security perspective:


*  Enhance general coding practices for better structures of source codes;


* Add enough unit tests to cover the possible use cases;


* Provide more comments per each function for readability, especially contracts that are verified in
public;


* Provide more transparency on privileged activities once the protocol is live.

## Finding Categories
### Gas Optimization

Gas Optimization findings do not affect the functionality of the code but generate different, more optimal EVM opcodes resulting in a reduction on the total gas cost of a transaction.

### Mathematical Operations
Mathematical Operation findings relate to mishandling of math formulas, such as overflows, incorrect operations etc.

### Logical Issue
Logical Issue findings detail a fault in the logic of the linked code, such as an incorrect notion on how block.timestamp works.

### Language Specific
Language Specific findings are issues that would only arise within Solidity, i.e. incorrect usage of private or delete.

### Coding Style
Coding Style findings usually do not affect the generated byte-code but rather comment on how to make the codebase more legible and, as a result, easily maintainable.

## Checksum Calculation Method
The "Checksum" field in the "Audit Scope" section is calculated as the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2 with digest size of 256 bits) digest of the content of each file hosted in the listed source repository under the specified commit. 

The result is hexadecimal encoded and is the same as the output of the Linux "sha256sum" command against the target file.
